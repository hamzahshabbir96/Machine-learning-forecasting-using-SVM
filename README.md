## Running the app locally


First create a virtual environment with conda or venv inside a temp folder, then activate it.



```bash
virtualenv 
Machine-learning-forecasting-using-SVM-venv

# Windows
Machine-learning-forecasting-using-SVM-venv\Scripts\activate
# Or Linux
Machine-learning-forecasting-using-SVM-venv/bin/activate

```
Clone the git repo, then install the requirements with pip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamzahshabbir96/Machine-learning-forecasting-using-SVM.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the app and follow local host 
```bash
python index.py
```
